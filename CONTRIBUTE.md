## Contributor License Agreement

52°North requires all contributors to sign a contributors license agreement (CLA). This is not scary but essential for open source projects to live beyond projects and individual contributions.

Find all information on our licensing page at http://52north.org/about/licensing/ and our CLA FAQ at http://52north.org/about/licensing/cla-guidelines.

## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes.

Before you start working on a new feature, create a new issue and start a discussion on the mailing list.
We follow the fork & pull development model: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
Use the 52°North code style for Ecplise: https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/Documentation/WebHome#Software_Development
Don't get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around 3 days.

# Bug triage
You can help report bugs by filing them here: https://github.com/GeoinformationSystems/GeoprocessingAppstore/issues

* Don't forget to check the existing ones first and take a look at the mailing list guidelines - going through these steps makes it likely that you can fix the bug yourself: http://52north.org/resources/mailing-list-and-forums/mailinglist-guidelines
* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if the bug is reproducible. Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)? What are the steps to reproduce?
